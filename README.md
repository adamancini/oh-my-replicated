# Oh My Replicated

This repository aggregates [custom plugins](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/#custom-plugins-and-themes) for [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) maintained by engineers at Replicated that we find useful. In general this repository will be for plugins which are customized and unlikely to be of wider user by the community. If a plugin is mature and generic to be of general use we should be committing it back upstream instead of carrying it here.

Each plugin should be prefaced with `replicated-` to avoid unintentional overrides of other plugins. Additionally plugins should be focused, split unrelated items into individual plugins to allow users to choose which ones they want to enable.

To install a plugin copy (or symlink!) the plugin to your custom folder `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins` and enable it in your `~/.zshrc` plugin list. Ex:

```zsh
plugins=(
        replicated-gcommands
        )
```

Or install with a plugin manager like [`antigen`](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) in your `.zshrc` file or wherever you configure `antigen`:

```bash
antigen bundle replicatedhq/oh-my-replicated@main
antigen apply
```

# gcommands plugin

Some commands to make working with gcloud easier.

## usage

To manage environments use [configurations](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/configurations).
These scripts will not override the configurations you are in and will display the current configuration when run.

You will need to have gcloud installed, on macOS you can do this with [brew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/google-cloud-sdk) `brew install --cask google-cloud-sdk`

You will need to set an environment variable `GUSER` to match your email user name.
You can optionally define a variable `GPREFIX` to prefix your instance names (generally the practice at Replicated is also to use your email user name).
If you've used brew to install gcloud the configuration would be:

```zsh
# Configure gcommands plugin
GUSER='chriss'
GPREFIX='chriss'

# Setup gcloud commands
source "/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/google-cloud-sdk/latest/google-cloud-sdk/completion.zsh.inc"
source "/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/google-cloud-sdk/latest/google-cloud-sdk/path.zsh.inc"
```
